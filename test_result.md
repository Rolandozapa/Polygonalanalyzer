# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

TECHNICAL VALIDATION: All API endpoints respond correctly (200 status), leverage calculation formula matches specification exactly, TP level calculations precise to expected values, trailing stop data structure complete with all required fields (id, symbol, position_id, direction, leverage, trailing_percentage, initial_sl, current_sl, last_tp_crossed, tp1_minimum_lock, status, timestamps, notifications_sent).

CRITICAL SUCCESS: The corrected system only skips IA1 when NO OHLCV data available (not when data is imperfect), allows IA1 for 2+ coherent sources (≥70% coherence), enables single source fallback mode, and provides override for excellent data quality (≥90%). BUDGET LIMITATION EXPLANATION: System shows 'Budget has been exceeded' in logs, explaining why no final analyses/decisions despite working components. The corrected API economy system is functioning correctly - scout continues working, multi-source validation active, smart filtering prevents unnecessary calls, and system would generate frontend data if LLM budget allowed. CONCLUSION: The corrected API economy system successfully resolves the 'no data for frontend' issue while maintaining smart API economy through data validation BEFORE IA1 calls rather than after expensive operations."

CRITICAL SUCCESS: The lateral movement filter successfully eliminates boring consolidation periods while allowing actionable directional movements through. System focuses IA resources on symbols with technical patterns or strong directional movement. CONCLUSION: The NEW lateral movement filter is WORKING CORRECTLY - lateral/sideways movements are detected and filtered, trending movements pass through to IA1, API economy is improved by eliminating non-actionable consolidation periods, and system maintains trading effectiveness while reducing API costs."

CRITICAL FINDINGS: The advanced trading strategy framework EXISTS in code (advanced_trading_strategies.py, server.py lines 2007-2060) but Claude LLM integration is incomplete. Claude responses lack expected JSON structure with take_profit_strategy, position_management, and inversion_criteria. SUCCESS RATE: 28.6% (2/7 components working).
