The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two main areas: refining the dynamic Risk-Reward (RR) escalation logic and resolving a critical fake market data issue. Initial efforts involved renaming  and  fields for consistency across , , and . This was followed by extensive debugging of the data flow, where the new fields were not correctly populated, leading to a series of fixes in  to ensure their inclusion in the  dictionary. During this process, several errors surfaced, including an  not defined error (fixed by replacing it with a VWAP-based alternative), a type-casting issue ( used as numeric), and an undefined  variable (fixed by uncommenting).

Upon user questioning the RR calculation, a deeper investigation revealed a severe issue: the system was using hardcoded, fake market data (.00 for all prices) instead of real BingX API data. This fake data was traced back to fallback mechanisms in . The AI engineer successfully removed these fake data fallbacks, ensuring the system now fails transparently when real data is unavailable. The final challenge involves integrating provided BingX API keys to re-enable real market data fetching, which was failing due to lack of authentication, but even with authentication, the data is still not flowing, indicating a filtering issue.

The Dual AI Trading Bot Ultra Professional Edition for BingX Futures leverages two LLMs: IA1 (GPT-4o) for initial technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution. IA1 escalates promising opportunities (confidence >70% or RR >= 2.0) to IA2, which requires >80% confidence. The system scouts top 50 BingX futures every four hours, filters out low volume/price and lateral patterns, and calculates entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels for independent risk-reward. It uses OHLCV data from multiple sources (10 days for scouting, 28 for IA1) and comprehensive technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, MFI, VWAP, ADX, ATR, Fibonacci). IA2 re-generates its own levels for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trends influence LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent enhancements include improved OHLCV fetching, institutional validation, market scoring, optimized RR thresholds, opportunity timestamps, and prevention of re-processing. The previous work fixed MACD, integrated Fibonacci, ensured robust Yahoo Finance data, made IA1/IA2 calculate their own levels, corrected IA2 escalation, and used official BingX symbols. The current development added advanced market regime detection, dynamic S/R and RR, multi-timeframe analysis, trade type recommendations (scalping, intraday, swing), and adaptive IA1->IA2 escalation thresholds. A key explicit request was that the fixed RR > 2.0 threshold is not suitable for all trade types, requiring dynamic adaptation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical issue where the application was failing to populate market opportunities with real data, despite the BingX API itself returning legitimate market information. Initially, the system was returning fake market data (.00 for all prices) due to hardcoded fallbacks in . These fallbacks have since been successfully removed, and validation logic was added to  to ensure only real data generates opportunities. Consequently, the system now transparently reports no_scout_data when valid market data isn't available.

The user provided a new BingX API key, which was added to , and authentication headers were integrated into the  method in . A manual  test confirmed the BingX API is now successfully fetching real-time market data (e.g., BTC-USDT at actual prices, with real volume and price changes). However, the  endpoint still indicates no_scout_data and an empty list of opportunities. This strongly suggests that the filtering logic within  or  is too strict or contains an error, preventing the valid BingX API data from being processed into actual market opportunities. The very last action taken was restarting the backend to ensure all recent changes, especially the API key integration, were fully applied before further debugging.

<optional_next_step>
My next step will be to confirm if the backend restart (the last action taken) successfully enables the flow of real BingX API data to opportunities. If not, I will investigate the filtering logic in  and  to identify why the fetched real data is not creating opportunities.
Last action performed: Let me restart the backend and see if the real BingX data now flows through to opportunities:
