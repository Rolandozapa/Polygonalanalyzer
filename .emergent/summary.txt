The previous AI engineer effectively established the foundational Dual AI Trading Bot, focusing on stability and core functionalities like MACD and Fibonacci integration, Yahoo Finance data, and resolving No patterns detected issues. Key efforts also ensured IA1 and IA2 independently calculated technical levels and RR, refined IA1→IA2 escalation, and fixed IA2 decision saving. Non-tradeable symbols were filtered via the official BingX API.

Upon receiving the project, I undertook a complete environment setup, replacing the codebase with the user-provided version and installing all dependencies. My subsequent work focused on iterative enhancements: first, integrating a new IA1 prompt (), then strategically merging advanced pattern detection into . A significant portion involved refactoring  by first attempting to replace it (which failed), then merging critical regime detection from , then reforging its entire logic around a  structure, and finally implementing user-suggested improvements like correct ADX, dynamic thresholds, and regime persistence/transitions, and more  enhancements, including creating . I also replaced the IA2 prompt (). Most recently, I added dynamic trade type recommendations and adaptive IA1→IA2 RR escalation based on trade type, and I am currently integrating these new fields into the  data model.

<product_requirements>
The Dual AI Trading Bot Ultra Professional Edition is an automated system for BingX Futures. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs initial technical analysis, escalating promising opportunities (>70% confidence or RR >= 2.0) to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence for execution. The system scouts the top 50 BingX futures every four hours, filtering by volume/price and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 is responsible for generating entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels for independent risk-reward calculation, detecting chart patterns, and providing detailed technical summaries. OHLCV data from multiple sources (10 days for scouting, 28 days for IA1) is fetched, and comprehensive technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF, Fibonacci) are calculated. IA2 regenerates its own levels and RR for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trends influence LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent enhancements include improved OHLCV fetching, institutional validation (Dune Analytics), market condition scoring, and optimized RR thresholds. The system also handles opportunity timestamps and prevents re-processing. The previous work fixed MACD, integrated Fibonacci, ensured robust Yahoo Finance data, made IA1/IA2 calculate their own levels, corrected IA2 escalation, and used official BingX symbols. The current development added advanced market regime detection, dynamic S/R and RR calculations, multi-timeframe analysis, trade type recommendations (scalping, intraday, swing), and adaptive IA1->IA2 escalation thresholds.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing dynamic minimum risk-reward (RR) escalation from IA1 to IA2, adapting the threshold based on the identified  (e.g., Scalping, Intraday, Swing). This addresses the user's explicit request that a fixed RR > 2.0 is not suitable for all trading strategies, particularly scalping.

The work involved:
1.  **Modifying **: A new method, , was added to calculate the appropriate minimum RR based on the  (e.g., 1.0 for Scalping, 1.5 for Intraday, 2.0 for Swing). The  method was updated to call this new function and return the .
2.  **Updating **: The  asynchronous method, which governs the escalation logic, was modified to use this dynamically calculated  instead of a hardcoded 2.0.
3.  **Updating **: The  Pydantic model was extended to include two new fields:  (e.g., Scalping, Intraday, Swing) and  (the calculated dynamic RR value). This ensures these critical new pieces of information are persisted and available throughout the system.

The last action recorded was the start of the process to ensure these newly added  and  fields are correctly passed and validated when creating the  object in , specifically by examining the  method. This indicates the task is in its final integration phase for these specific features.
