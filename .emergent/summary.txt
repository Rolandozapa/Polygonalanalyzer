The provided trajectory documents the AI engineer's extensive work on enhancing a dual AI trading bot. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing core data flows by migrating from fake data to real BingX API integration and addressing  and f-string errors in . A major undertaking involved implementing a robust TALib-based indicator system, which necessitated a significant refactoring into a modular architecture, externalizing configurations and prompts, and generating documentation. The engineer meticulously debugged numerous issues, including abstract method implementations, case sensitivity in OHLCV data columns, undefined variables (, , , ),  errors, and  issues, often caused by incorrect variable types or missing definitions in f-strings and data processing. The latest efforts focused on replacing the IA1 prompt entirely with a new v6.0 JSON-based prompt, making the  dynamic from IA1 analysis, fixing IA2's strategic reasoning and RR display, and is currently in the process of externalizing all prompts to a dedicated  directory for better maintainability and to eliminate hardcoded fallbacks.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot for BingX Futures uses IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution. IA1 identifies high-confidence opportunities (confidence >70% or RR >= 2.0) and escalates them to IA2 (requiring >80% confidence). The system scouts top 50 BingX futures, filters out low volume/price and lateral patterns, and calculates entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels with independent risk-reward. It uses multi-source OHLCV data and comprehensive technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, MFI, VWAP, ADX, ATR, and Fibonacci. Recent efforts focused on dynamic RR thresholds, advanced market regime detection, multi-timeframe analysis, and adaptive IA1->IA2 escalation. Implementation has fixed fake market data, integrated BingX API, filtered to top 25 market cap symbols, and initiated refactoring for a robust TALib-based indicator system. The user has also explicitly requested that the  (scalp, intraday, swing, position) and corresponding RR thresholds be dynamically extracted from IA1 analysis, rather than being hardcoded, and for IA2 strategic reasoning to be properly displayed.

-   : The core FastAPI application. This file underwent extensive modifications to integrate TALib indicators, handle data flow, construct IA1 prompts, and address numerous runtime errors (e.g., , , ) during the integration process. It now includes logic for dynamic  and RR thresholds.
-   : Defines Pydantic models. Minor field renames for consistency.
-   : Fetches trending cryptos. Modified to integrate BingX API and filter top 25 market cap symbols.
-   : Fetches OHLCV data. Identified to return capitalized column names, which was handled in .
-   : Stores environment variables. Updated with various API keys.
-   : Base class for indicators. Modified during debugging to align with  method signature ().
-   : (IN PROGRESS) Implements comprehensive TALib-based indicator calculations. Fixed to handle capitalized OHLCV columns and provide a complete minimal analysis output.
-   : New directory for externalized prompts. , , , , and  have been created to replace inline prompts.
-   : (NEW) Manages loading and formatting prompts, now intended to replace the direct string formatting in .
-   , , : Documentation files providing architectural and technical guides.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of multiple OHLCV data sources for CoinMarketCap, TwelveData, and CoinAPI.
- Fully implement the actual data fetching logic within .
- Add the display of timestamps to the IA1 and IA2 thumbnails in the frontend.
- Complete the database saving logic for IA2 decisions in the  endpoint.
- Continue the migration of the application to the new modular architecture, specifically integrating the new  to load externalized prompts.
- Thoroughly test the IA2 strategic decision process, including ensuring correct RR calculation and display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing issues with the IA2 Strategic Decisions. The primary problems identified were: No strategic reasoning provided in the UI, incorrect default values (50% confidence, 1.0:1 R:R), and inconsistent hold signals.

Investigation revealed that the  was hardcoded to 'SWING', and the IA1 prompt (v6.0) was not asking GPT for the trade type. The AI engineer corrected this by:
1.  Adding  and  to the IA1 prompt in .
2.  Modifying the code to extract  from the IA1 JSON response instead of using a hardcoded value.
3.  Implementing dynamic RR thresholds (SCALP: 1.0, INTRADAY: 1.5, SWING: 2.0, POSITION: 2.5) based on the extracted .
4.  Adding enhanced debug logs to confirm these values are being processed correctly.
5.  Fixing lingering  f-string errors in logging messages.

The system is now successfully extracting  and dynamically mapping RR thresholds. The next logical step, requested by the user, is to remove fallbacks and externalize all prompts into a dedicated  directory to facilitate easier modification and ensure the new, complete prompts are always used, rather than a mix of old logic and new templates. The AI has just created the externalized prompt files (, , , , ) within the  directory.
