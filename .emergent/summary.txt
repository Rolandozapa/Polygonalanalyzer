<analysis>
The AI engineer's work involved developing a dual AI trading bot from an MVP stage. Key achievements include migrating to real BingX API data, implementing TALib-based indicators, and refactoring into a modular architecture. A major focus was externalizing and upgrading IA1 and IA2 prompts to Ultra Professional versions and resolving numerous data flow and mapping discrepancies. This included fixing  errors, f-string issues, and ensuring dynamic  extraction. Persistent problems like critical indicators showing as  or  were systematically debugged and fixed by correcting data filtering in  and adjusting MACD calculation parameters. The engineer also streamlined indicators for IA1 to reduce redundancy and introduced multi-timeframe analysis. The current task is to debug column normalization issues in the newly implemented multi-timeframe system.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot for BingX Futures uses IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution, identifying high-confidence trading opportunities. It utilizes multi-source OHLCV data and a comprehensive, now streamlined, set of technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, VWAP, ADX, ATR, and Fibonacci. Key features include dynamic RR thresholds, advanced market regime detection, and an emerging multi-timeframe analysis capability.

Explicit user requests and implemented features:
1.  **Prompt Management**: Externalized and upgraded IA1 (v7.0 Ultra) and IA2 (v3.0 Strategic Ultra) prompts.
2.  **Dynamic Trading Logic**: Dynamically extracts  and RR thresholds from IA1.
3.  **Frontend Vignette Updates**: Enhanced IA1/IA2 displays to integrate new fields and detailed indicators.
4.  **Data Reliability**: Fixed / issues for MACD, ATR, ADX, Current Price, SMA/EMA, ensuring real-time calculation and display.
5.  **API Fallback**: Implemented and verified a robust multi-source API fallback system.
6.  **Indicator Streamlining**: Reduced redundant indicators for IA1 to improve analysis focus.
7.  **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Initiated implementation of a multi-timeframe approach (15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) for comprehensive token analysis.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing a multi-timeframe analysis system to provide a more comprehensive technical overview for IA1. This involved creating new modules (, ) and integrating their logic into  to fetch and process data from 15m, 1h, 4h, and 1d timeframes. The  Pydantic model and IA1 prompts (, ) were updated to incorporate these new multi-timeframe signals.

The system showed initial success, with logs confirming multi-timeframe analysis completion for ETHUSDT, yielding a  signal with a . However, critical issues quickly emerged:
1.  **Data Persistence**: Multi-timeframe analysis results were not being saved to the MongoDB database.
2.  **Column Normalization Errors**: Errors indicating missing  and  columns appeared during Fibonacci/TALib calculations within the multi-timeframe pipeline, leading to fallback activations and incomplete analyses.

The last action taken was to begin debugging these column normalization issues by correcting column casing ( to ,  to ,  to ) in . The engineer is currently in the process of identifying and fixing further inconsistencies in column naming across data processing steps.
