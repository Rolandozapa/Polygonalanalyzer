The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing a Dual AI Trading Bot, addressing several critical issues. Initially, the core tasks were to fix consistent zero values for MACD, integrate Fibonacci retracements, and ensure robust Yahoo Finance data fetching. Debugging MACD involved identifying and correcting a numpy type conversion issue in 's  method, and later, fixing multiple assignments overwriting the correct MACD line value. Fibonacci retracement was successfully added with a new  module and integrated into .

A major part of the work revolved around rectifying the No patterns detected issue, which led to re-enabling Yahoo Finance OHLCV fetching and pattern detection logic in  and . Subsequent efforts focused on ensuring IA1 uses its own calculated technical levels for risk-reward (RR) assessment, rather than hardcoded values, by correcting  references to  in calculation and validation logic.

Further, the AI engineer addressed IA2's behavior, ensuring it also calculates its own technical levels and RR, rather than overwriting them with hardcoded percentages. The IA1â†’IA2 escalation logic was modified multiple times, first to an adaptive market alignment strategy, then simplified to a two-path system (confidence > 95% OR RR > 2.0). A critical bug was found and fixed where IA2 decisions were not being saved to the database. Lastly, non-tradeable symbols like XTZUSDT were removed from the scouting process by relying on the official BingX API for symbol fetching, replacing hardcoded lists.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot automates BingX Futures trading. IA1 (GPT-4o) performs technical analysis, escalating opportunities with >70% confidence or RR >= 2.0 to IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), which requires >80% confidence. The system scouts top 50 BingX futures every 4 hours, filtered by volume/price and excluding lateral patterns. IA1 must analyze these, generate entry, stop-loss, take-profit levels for independent RR calculation, detect chart patterns, and produce detailed technical summaries, avoiding duplicate tokens. OHLCV data (10 days for scout, 28 for IA1) must be systematically fetched from multiple sources, and all technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA multi-TF, MFI, VWAP multi-TF) calculated. IA2 regenerates its own levels and RR for execution (RR > 2.0 trigger). Global market trend logic adjusts LONG/SHORT confidence. Recent additions include enhanced OHLCV data sources, institutional validation via Dune Analytics, a sophisticated market condition scoring system for IA1, and optimized RR thresholds. The system must also correctly handle and display opportunity timestamps and prevent re-processing tokens within 4 hours. The current work in the trajectory focused on fixing MACD, integrating Fibonacci retracements, ensuring robust Yahoo Finance integration, ensuring IA1/IA2 calculate and use their own technical levels, correcting IA2 escalation logic, and using official BingX symbols.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on ensuring that IA2 decisions, which were being correctly generated, were also being persisted to the database and consequently appearing in the frontend's IA2 tab. It was identified that the  object, after being created by the , was being returned by the  method but was not explicitly saved to the MongoDB database in the main orchestrator loop (line 9218-9220 in ). The same oversight was also noted for the  endpoint.

The last action taken was to add the database saving logic for IA2 decisions in the orchestrator's main processing flow and for the  endpoint. This crucial fix ensures that all valid IA2 decisions are correctly stored and can then be retrieved by the frontend.
The system now incorporates:
- Fully functional pattern detection (Yahoo Finance OHLCV re-enabled, pattern detection in  re-activated).
- Accurate MACD calculations and display (persistent, non-zero values across the backend and API).
- Fibonacci retracement integration.
- IA1 and IA2 determining their own technical levels and RR calculations.
- A simplified IA1->IA2 escalation logic: either confidence > 95% OR RR > 2.0.
- Reliable fetching of BingX tradable symbols directly from the official API.
- IA2 decisions are now expected to be correctly saved to the database.
