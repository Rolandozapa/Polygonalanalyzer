The AI engineer's work spanned several critical areas for the dual AI trading bot. Initially, it focused on debugging multi-timeframe analysis column normalization issues, leading to the creation of a utility function and systematic fixes across  to ensure consistent data column casing. Subsequently, a major effort was dedicated to correcting the Risk-Reward (RR) calculation, which involved addressing model discrepancies in , fixing erroneous RR clamping in , and critically, integrating advanced support/resistance detection methods from a user-provided React module into . This significantly improved RR accuracy and IA2 acceptance. The latest phase involved debugging inconsistencies in IA1's analysis, stemming from deprecated indicators (, ) causing prompt fallback. The engineer systematically removed these references from prompt templates and , but is currently still resolving a lingering .

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot for BingX Futures leverages IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution, targeting high-confidence trading opportunities. It integrates multi-source OHLCV data and a streamlined set of technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, VWAP, ADX, ATR, Fibonacci). Key features include dynamic Risk-Reward (RR) thresholds, advanced market regime detection, and a developing multi-timeframe analysis system (15m, 1h, 4h, 1d).

Implemented features so far:
1.  **Prompt Management**: IA1 (v7.0 Ultra) and IA2 (v3.0 Strategic Ultra) prompts externalized and upgraded.
2.  **Dynamic Trading Logic**:  and RR thresholds dynamically extracted from IA1.
3.  **Data Reliability**: Fixed / issues for key indicators (MACD, ATR, ADX, Current Price, SMA/EMA).
4.  **Indicator Streamlining**: Removed redundant indicators for IA1 to enhance focus.
5.  **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Initial implementation for 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d timeframes, including data persistence.
6.  **Risk-Reward Accuracy**: Significantly improved RR calculation by integrating advanced support/resistance detection logic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical inconsistency where IA1 was recommending LONG despite strong bearish signals (negative MACD, TRENDING_DOWN_STRONG ML regime). This was traced back to the IA1 ultra prompt not being used due to missing variables (, ) and a fallback to a basic prompt.

The previous engineer systematically removed all references to the deprecated  and  indicators from  and various parts of  (assignments, extractions, logs, fallback logic,  population, IA2 confluence logs, and tests).

Despite extensive cleanup, a  error persists in the backend logs, specifically traced to a function call around line 3198 in  (e.g.,  as a parameter). This indicates a remaining, hardcoded reference to  in a function signature or call that needs to be removed or updated. The AI engineer is currently in the process of identifying and removing this final, elusive reference to  to allow the expert IA1 prompt to load correctly.
