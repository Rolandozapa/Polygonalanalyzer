<analysis>
The AI engineer's work focused on enhancing a dual AI trading bot. Initial efforts involved migrating from fake data to real BingX API, implementing a robust TALib-based indicator system, and refactoring into a modular architecture. A significant part of the trajectory involved externalizing AI prompts (IA1 and IA2), upgrading them to Ultra Professional versions based on user-provided templates, and debugging numerous data flow and mapping issues between TALib calculations and the final  object. Challenges included  errors, f-string issues, ensuring dynamic  extraction, debugging intermittent BingX API failures by verifying a multi-source data fallback system, and resolving persistent discrepancies where correct TALib calculations were not reflected in the API response or frontend due to incorrect data mapping.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot for BingX Futures uses IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution. It identifies high-confidence trading opportunities using multi-source OHLCV data and comprehensive technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, MFI, VWAP, ADX, ATR, Fibonacci). Key features include dynamic RR thresholds, advanced market regime detection, and multi-timeframe analysis.

Explicit user requests and implemented features:
1.  **Prompt Management**: Externalize IA1 and IA2 prompts, upgrading them to more advanced v7.0 Ultra (IA1) and v3.0 Strategic Ultra (IA2) versions.
2.  **Dynamic Trading Logic**: Dynamically extract  (scalp, intraday, swing, position) and associated RR thresholds from IA1 analysis.
3.  **Frontend Vignette Updates**: Enhance IA1 and IA2 frontend displays () to integrate and visually represent the rich data from the new prompt versions, including specific indicators like VWAP, MACD, ATR, ADX, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ML Regime, Confluence Grade, and IA1 reasoning.
4.  **Data Reliability**: Ensure accurate and real-time calculation and display of all technical indicators, specifically fixing issues with MACD (0.0000), ATR (low values), ADX (fallback values), Current Price, SMA/EMA (0.0000).
5.  **API Fallback**: Implement and verify a robust multi-source API fallback system () to complete historical OHLCV data when the primary BingX API is intermittent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent mapping issues for several critical technical indicators and price levels that were showing as  or  in the final API response, despite being correctly calculated by TALib and logged internally. This included , , . The  was confirmed to be genuinely  in consolidation scenarios, not a fallback.

The AI engineer systematically debugged the data flow, identifying and resolving several critical issues:
1.  ** Fixes**: Replaced direct access to  attributes (e.g., ) with  in  to prevent silent exceptions that were interrupting the data flow.
2.  ** Definition Order**: Fixed an error where  was used before its definition in .
3.  **Corrected  Population**: Identified that  was completely missing from the  call, and corrected conditions for  during mapping.
4.  **Final Mapping Discrepancy**: Despite these fixes, crucial values like , , and  still appeared as  in the final API response. The AI engineer discovered that there are **five different creations** of  objects in  and suspects that the final object creation (specifically involving  from ) might be overwriting or filtering the correctly populated .

The current state is that the multi-source fallback system is proven to work perfectly, TALib calculations are proven to produce correct values, and most UI elements are updated. However, a core data integrity issue remains where some calculated values are not correctly persisted into the final  object returned by the API.
