The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows a dedicated effort to evolve a trading bot from basic functionality to a more robust, data-driven system. Initial work focused on fixing critical data flow issues, moving from fake market data to real BingX API integration. This involved extensive debugging of data processing, resolving  errors and f-string formatting issues in , and implementing a reliable startup data fetch. Subsequently, the engineer implemented user-requested features such as integrating multiple premium API keys and filtering BingX opportunities to the top 25 market cap symbols. A significant portion of the work then addressed architectural flaws where IA1 was not using correct indicator data, leading to the development and integration of a comprehensive TALib-based indicator system. The trajectory culminates in a proactive decision to refactor the entire application into a modular architecture, externalize configurations and prompts, and create extensive documentation to facilitate future development.

The Dual AI Trading Bot Ultra Professional Edition for BingX Futures employs IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for execution. IA1 escalates high-confidence opportunities (confidence >70% or RR >= 2.0) to IA2, which requires >80% confidence. The system scouts top 50 BingX futures, filters out low volume/price and lateral patterns, and calculates entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels with independent risk-reward. It utilizes OHLCV data from multiple sources and comprehensive technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, EMA/SMA, MFI, VWAP, ADX, ATR, and Fibonacci. Recent enhancements focused on advanced market regime detection, dynamic S/R and RR, multi-timeframe analysis, and adaptive IA1->IA2 escalation thresholds, with a key request for dynamic RR thresholds. Implementation has progressed through resolving fake market data, integrating BingX API, implementing top 25 market cap filtering, and beginning a refactor to integrate a robust TALib-based indicator system.

-   : The core FastAPI application. This file has undergone significant modifications to manage data flow from BingX, remove all hardcoded fallback values for indicators, integrate  (later replaced), and then . It also handles IA1 prompt construction, passing of TALib variables, and extensive error handling related to  comparisons and f-string formatting.
-   : Defines Pydantic models. Minor field renames for consistency ( to ,  to ).
-   : Fetches trending cryptos from BingX. Changes include removing fake data fallbacks, integrating BingX API keys (, ), adding an immediate startup data fetch, and implementing a filter to prioritize top 25 market cap symbols.
-   : Aggregates market data. Implemented cache invalidation and validation logic to reject fake data and ensure only real market data forms opportunities.
-   : Stores environment variables. Updated with , , , , .
-   : New file created to store a backup of premium API keys provided by the user.
-   : (DEPRECATED) A temporary, simpler indicator calculation system created after issues with .
-   : (IN PROGRESS) New file created to implement a comprehensive, TALib-based indicator system.
-   : A markdown document outlining the plan for the application's refactoring into a modular structure.
-   : New directory for externalized configurations.  and  were created.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of multiple OHLCV data sources for CoinMarketCap, TwelveData, and CoinAPI (CoinAPI is currently returning 403).
- Fully implement the actual data fetching logic within .
- Add the display of timestamps to the IA1 and IA2 thumbnails in the frontend.
- Complete the database saving logic for IA2 decisions in the  endpoint.
- Continue the migration of the application to the new modular architecture (moving existing logic into the new , , ,  structures).
- Complete the implementation and testing of the  module based on the detailed specifications provided by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a major architectural refactoring of the application. The previous steps involved fixing persistent issues where IA1 was producing analyses with  for all technical indicators or encountering  errors due to a flawed  module. This led to the temporary creation of , and then the decision to fully integrate a robust, TALib-based indicator system.

The engineer received a detailed specification of all required TALib indicators from the user and had successfully:
1. Created a new, modular directory structure including , , , , , and .
2. Externalized configurations into  and .
3. Externalized the IA1 prompt into .
4. Created a  in .
5. Created a base indicator system foundation in .
6. Generated comprehensive  and  documentation detailing the new architecture and system.

The very last action was the creation of the file  to implement the comprehensive TALib-based indicator system as specified by the user, and the agent was about to test this new module.
